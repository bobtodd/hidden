abstract = {The demonstrations of von Neumann and others, that quantum mechanics does not permit a hidden variable interpretation, are reconsidered.  It is shown that their essential axioms are unreasonable.  It is urged that in further examination of the problem an interesting axiom would be that mutually distant systems are independent of one another.},
